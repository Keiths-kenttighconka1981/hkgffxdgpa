Man, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marching Powder, and it's a total ride, you know what I mean? Like, it’s just crazy how they run things on the inside. Seriously, makes you think about how life can be so different in there, but also... kind of the same? Somehow? I dunno, it’s wild. One second you're laughing at something absurd, and the next it’s just all so grim and scary.

So, there’s this whole part with the tourists visiting the prison, and I'm like, what even is real anymore? The guards just letting people waltz around like it’s Sunday brunch. Imagine being on a tour and thinking, “Oh, I might just meet a convict who might pickpocket me? Cool.” Honestly, I need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and make everyone 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just for that “WTF!” moment alone.

> And that whole bit where he talks about smuggling? It’s bizarrely fascinating. I mean, not that I’d try it or anything, but just listening was like, how do people come up with this stuff? Creativity at its finest, but not in a good way, y'know? It's like, bro, use that genius for something not illegal maybe?

Then, there’s all these moments where you see kindness between prisoners, and it’s heartwarming. But then, boom, something harsh happens, and you’re reminded it’s still prison. Constant mental backflips trying to process it all.

I dunno, I'm kind of rambling now, but it’s just like the   sticks with you. It’s got these layers where you’re just... trying to unpack everything and still come out with more questions. How did I even end up here talking about this? My brain is just full of all the chaos, haha. Anyway, if you haven’t seen it yet, give it a shot and let me know what you think.

let chaos = true;

Think I’m going to grab some shut-eye or at least lay there and stare at the ceiling. The prison tours in my mind won't stop anytime soon. Catch you later!
